Event Logs – 

All the critical components of Windows and its core applications use the Windows Event Log mechanism to store details of
their events. Windows Event Logs are utilized for logging kernel and user mode events. Security and low-level hardware events
are also logged in Windows Event Logs. Therefore, understanding these logs is necessary for system administrators, cybersecurity
professionals, and digital forensics practitioners.

Microsoft Windows provides a centralized logging mechanism that applications and the operating system can use to store
their events. Windows provides an application called Event Viewer, which can be used to view these logs. Windows Event Viewer
was introduced in Windows NT and has been part of all the versions of Windows since then.
Windows Event Logs typically contains the following information – 

• Level – indicates the severity of the logged event. Following are the log levels available in Windows Event Logs – 

Log Level                                                          Description

Verbose                                                          Detailed output of the event log entry

Information                                                     Generally used by applications and operating system components to denote successful execution of an operation.

Warning                                                          Not an error, but a possible source of issues in future

Error                                                               Failure of an operation. It may indicate the source of a problem in an operating system service, component or application.

Critical                                                            The major issue that should be addressed immediately.

The levels of event log entries are decided by the developers of the applications or services. The levels “Verbose” and
“Information” generally contain informational messages such as successful completion of background tasks and so on. The levels,
Warning, Error, and Critical are degrees of the criticality of failure cases.

• Date and Time –  timestamp of the occurrence of an event.
• Source application or service that generated the event may include services or applications of the operating system.
• Event ID –  a unique ID of the event being logged. The same ID is expected to be used in all the instances of the event being logged. For example, Event ID with a value of 4624 has a description “An account was successfully                   logged on.”
• Task Category – applications that have generated the event, the “event source”, can further categorize the event by giving the event a number and a text label. For example, events with ID 4624 have a task category “Logon”.                             This field helps users of Windows Event Viewer to filter events.

Event log parameters and description – 

Keywords associated with the event  –   They are text strings associated with an event. The developer of the application provides these strings.

User  –  The Windows user login associated with the event.

Operational Code  –  The internal code assigned by the application to the operation being performed when the event was logged

Log  –  Type of the log, typically Application, Security, etc.

Computer  –  Name of the computer

Thread ID  –  ID of the thread belonging to the process that generated the event

Process ID  –  ID of the process that generated the event

Session ID  –  Remote terminal session ID

Kernel Time  –  CPU time units utilized by kernel-mode instructions

User Time   –  CPU time units utilized by user-mode instructions

Processor Time  –  CPU ticks utilized by user-mode instructions

Correlation ID  –  It is the internal activity ID in the process that generated the event

Relative Correlation ID  –  It is related activity ID in the process that generated the event
